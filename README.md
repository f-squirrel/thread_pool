Thread Pool
===========


This is a C++ 11/14 thread pool implementation inspired by ["C++ Concurrency in Action: Practical Multithreading"](https://www.amazon.com/C-Concurrency-Action-Practical-Multithreading/dp/1933988770) by Anthony Williams.

The library is header-only and supposed to be compatible with any C++ 11/14 compiler.
<br>The only 3rd party is Google Test, and it is optional.

## Build ##
```sh
git clone --recursive https://github.com/f-squirrel/thread_pool.git
cd thread_pool
mkdir build && cd build
cmake -DBUILD_TESTING=ON ..
make
make test
make install
```

## Change the default namespace

The default namespace is `thread_pool`, there are two ways to change it:
* Via compilation flags `-DTHREAD_POOL_NAMESPACE_NAME=<your favorite namespace>`.
* Via changing `#define THREAD_POOL_NAMESPACE_NAME thread_pool` in ThreadPool.hpp.

## Integration

There are two ways to integrate `thread_pool` in a project:
1. Git submodule
    * Add this repository as a git submodule to your project.
    * Add the thread_pool/include to your include path:
        ```
        include_directories(${CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR}/submodules/thread_pool/include)
        ```    
2. Just copy the
[thread_pool](https://github.com/f-squirrel/thread_pool/tree/master/include/thread_pool)
directory to your project directory
