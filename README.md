Thread Pool
===========


This is a C++ 11/14 thread pool implementation inspired by "C++ Concurrency in Action: Practical Multithreading" by Anthony Williams.

The library is header-only and supposed to be compatible with any C++ 11/14 compatible compiler.
To run it you need no 3rd parties.
The only 3rd party you need is boost unit test to compile and run tests.

## Build ##
```sh
cd thread_pool
mkdir build && cd build
cmake -DBUILD_TESTING=ON ..
make
make test
make install
```
